# DragonGame
A program that plays a game similar to rock, paper, scissors with the user.
This was a project I completed in the CSE1223 Intro to Programming in Java course I took at Ohio State University, and it is my favorite program that I have made. The user ca choose how many games they play against the computer, and in each round the user is asked which dragon they would like to pick. Water beats fire, fire beats plant, and plant beats water. I received a 100% on this project.
